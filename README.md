# Thesis project - React App

Simple time tracking software made with React.

## Idea

This time tracking software is a part of my thesis project, in which I compare the software maintainability and how
it is affected by the front-end framework in use.

Backend for this project available at: tobeannounced

Run project locally:

```
npm start
```
